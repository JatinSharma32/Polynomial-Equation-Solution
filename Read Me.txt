            -:  POLYNOMIAL EQUATION SOLUTION  :-

Basic working: This program gives you two values which gives
               negetive and positive value when putted in
               equation, this program is designed to take the
               equation as input(Polynomial Equation only).

Inputs: -> The number of times you want to run the code.
        -> The degree of equation(Highest power of the equation).
        -> You will be asked to enter the Coefficients of each 
           term according to the provided degree.

Output: -> You will get those 2 values from equation 
           (Stated above).
